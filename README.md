### I'm Kourosh Kaveh. I know it may be hard to say.
jus kidin' I actually don't have any idea how hard it is for **you** to say my name. :D

So github says i should use this format to *get myself started:*

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `Nothing special at the moment.`
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `Python, C++.`
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on `Nothing special at the moment.`
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with `Nothing special at the moment.`
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about `Nothing cuz I might not be able to help.`
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: `YOU CAN'T REACH ME ğŸ˜ˆğŸ˜ˆ.`
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: `I, you, he, she, we, they, it.`
- âš¡ Fun fact: `Did you know that :| is not the same as |: ?`
